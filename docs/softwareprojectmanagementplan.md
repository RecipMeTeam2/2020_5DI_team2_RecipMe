# 1     Overview

## 1.1   Purpose and Scope

Our team is interested in creating a website that allows users and food fans to communicate with each other by sharing recipes and rating them. 

 

Recip.me distinguishes itself form other food web-services through the openness and the wide choice that it offers product-wise. 

 

The project is going to be expanded in order to welcome food providers and producers

 

## 1.2   Goals and Objectives

The main goals of this application will be to develop a recipe database that will provide the following:

1. Collect     recipes that the users will upload.
2. Allow     users to submit feedback and change the recipes.
3. Allow     users to order the products directly from the website.
4. Allow     users to create a personal customed account.
5. Allow     user to change temporarily the ingredients of a recipe while performing     the order.

## 4.2   Configuration Management Plan

The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work products:

 

1. All project work products will be stored in decentralized     GitHub repository.
2. All baselined documents will have a Document Control     section with a change history to track initialization and subsequent     changes.
3. All project work products (documents, source code, test     cases, program data, test data, etc) will be stored in the GitHub     repository but not all will be under change control (subject to formal     change control procedures.) Only the system requirements, project plan and     source code will be baselined and under configuration control.
4. Items that are subject to change control will be     considered baselined after a group review at the end of the initial     document creation. 
5. The change control procedure once a product is     baselined is: 

(1) anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item has to let the rest of the team and project sponsor know, describing the change, reason for the change, expected schedule impact, and time line for integrating the change. 

(2) If no reason is found why change request shouldn't be permitted, it will be considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.

(3)  if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their opinion. At the end of the meeting a democratic vote will be held to decide whether or not the change should be allowed.

(4)  if a change takes place, the initiator must collaborate with the project manager to update the schedule

##  

## 5.2   Test Plan

The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing, and a schedule detailing the tasks, owners, and time line.

 

## 5.3   Product Acceptance Plan

At the conclusion of each iteration, the prototype created will be tested to ensure it meets the requirements of that iteration.  For testing out the product changes, the test product will be hosted by altervista, with another url. 

 

For the final iteration, product acceptance testing will ensure that the prototype functions as expected with a user's data.
