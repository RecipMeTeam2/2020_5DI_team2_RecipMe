**1.**       **Purpose**

 

The purpose of this Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is to serve as a written understanding between Federal Communications Commission and the GPI_Team2. This MOU documents the responsibilities of the principal organizations involved in the deployment of Recip.me.

 

**2.      Objectives, Scope, and Major Activities**

 

- **Objective:** The objective of Recip.me is to provide integrated automation of the following features: 

  - Create recipes and sharing them to the other users
  - Evaluating other users’ recipes
  -  Adding recipes to the shopping cart in order to buy the ingredients which compose a certain recipe
  - Modifying the list of items to buy in the shopping cart

  This system will be available for the use to everyone, since it is an online platform, users will only    need an Internet connection

 

q **Major Activities:** The major activities of this system will be to manage Recip.me in accordance with GPI_Team2, FCC Computer Security Program Directive, FCC Instruction 1479.2 and other relevant FCC guidance. The FCC system custodian will ensure that the system, designing and engineering concept, architectural and interface baselines and interoperability at all levels is consistent with FCC policies, including the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and change management processes. 

 

**3.      Responsibilities**

 

- **Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Program/Custodian Office**

 

As the principal FCC representative for the Recip.me functional area, the GPI teacher is the proponent for the Recip.me and is ultimately responsible for review and validation of the system documentation and proposed system modifications. In addition, the GPI teacher will:

 

1. Seek support for, program for, budget, and provide the funding necessary for successful integration of the system, including all necessary information assurance, data and computer security requirements;

2. Ensure that appropriate ITC program managers and the Customer Service Representative are kept appraised of any planned or proposed system modifications so that adequate time for consideration can be offered to the system;

3. Ensure that required strategic functional plan for Recip.me are developed;

4. Provide all required information pertaining to the system, its characteristics and configuration to allow FCC personnel to classify the system as required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III and other Federal mandates;

5. Ensure compliance with all applicable Federal mandates with regard to computer-based system usage; and

6. Sign this agreement and act in the best interest of the FCC to ensure continued availability and integrity of Recip.me and associated data.

 

 

 

 

- **MOU Federal Agency Name**
