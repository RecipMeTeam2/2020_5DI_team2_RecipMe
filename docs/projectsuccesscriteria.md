# Success criteria for recipMe Project

The recipMe project will be considered a success if . . . 

**A fully functional test system is delivered.**

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose.

We will consider our goals met if the users who use the system during its test period fill out the attached Acceptance Test User Survey and:

- No one circles “No” on the first question;
- If anyone circles “Yes, with reservations” on the first question, these reservations shall be resolved prior to a week after the test is over to the satisfaction of the users with the reservations.



**A working database is set up.**

Data from our users as well as all the information regarding the recipes are stored in a fully functional database.



**The system is properly documented.**

A user guide shall be produced and included with the system. This guide shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic internet concepts. The user guide shall only explain how to use all the features of the system.

Secondly, an architecture and design document shall be produced, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours of looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes.
