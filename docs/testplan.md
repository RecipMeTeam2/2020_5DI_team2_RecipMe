# IDENTIFIER

 

Recip.me website Test Plan 



------



# INTRODUCTION

 

This exercise essentially discovers faults and failures in the website code and in the database management. Faults lead to failures and testing is necessary to eliminate errors in the code. The following document outlines the testing procedures for recip.me website. 

 

## Items and Features Tested

The features tested include the user website and the database management.

 

## Test Specifications

This section highlights the different levels of testing performed during the website development process. It includes  tests performed by the team tester  to verify that the web-pages fulfills the requirements and performs as expected. The complete testing procedures are outlined in the test specifications document.



## Test Reports

Test reports offer feedback about the testing exercise and are informational to project stakeholders. 

 

Code-failures reports track descriptions of coding failures, the origin, the line, current status and the cause. The document will also track in what phase of the development process the failure was created or detected.



 

## Project Plan

The project plan reconciles the time schedule and the release of the website. 

 

## Quality Assurance Plan

Yet to be defined. 

 



# ITEMS AND FEATURES TESTED

 

## User Website

 

User website testing takes place in the integration and system testing phases. During integration, the tester will test functions of the site and how it respond. During system testing, the team will test the system as a whole and check the results with the requirements. 

 

Test items:

 

§ Verify user as Recip.me User

§ User read a recipe

§ User interaction with the website

 

## User additional functions

 

User additional functions testing takes place in the integration and system testing. The tester will test functions of the project during integration,  will retest them after features are added to make sure they still function correctly.  

System testing will test all aspects of the system and cross-check them with the requirements document to ensure that the client’s requirements have been fulfilled. 

 

Test items:

 

§ User creating a recipe

§ Cart connection with amazon

§ User orders

§ User interaction with profile

§ Recipe rating and comments

  



# APPROACH

 

## Strategy

The testing approach includes team members role-playing by acting as users of the website.

 The activities they carry out will be similar to activities carried out by website users. These include creating recipes, ordering ingredients,  posting comments, rating recipes and profile managing. Team members will also create unexpected scenarios such as invalid input, to test how the system will respond to such scenarios.

 

System testing will be performed by the group to measure how the system fulfills the requirements. Team members will be required to provide input on the systems functionality to determine if it measures up to the client’s expectations. 

 

## Techniques/Tools

 

Developers will perform unit tests to check code functionality and execution of the software, and perform white-box testing. Testers and team members will also go through the code to find bugs and errors that the developers might not detect. 

 

## Test Goals

 

The goals of this testing exercise include finding various user situations and testing against these situations in order to discover any errors that may cause failures. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the team delivers an error-free functioning system. 

 

 

# TEST DELIVERABLES

 

- A test plan that delineates the testing phase of the development process
- A test specification document detailing steps in the testing procedures
- Test reports documenting code failures





# **TESTING TASKS**

Testing tasks for integration and system testing are outlined in the test specification document. 

 

 

# SCHEDULE 

 

Testing will occur at each phase of the development process. Test cases are outlined in the test specification document for the iterations.
