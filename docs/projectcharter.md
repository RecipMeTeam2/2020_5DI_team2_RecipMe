| **Stakeholders  and Expectations:**  
**Team:** Creating a functional website in order to display food recipes.  The website will be responsive, user-friendly and with a simple design.     
**Sponsors:**  Have a good website that work without problems.     **Web users:** Use this  site to enhance the cooking experience. |
| **Purpose  (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**:  Users who take advantage of this site will  have a quick and easy way to order ingredients of multiple recipes in order  to prepare good meals. A user must log into the site to add ingredients to  his shopping cart. This will help web users to improve their cooking skills  with little effort. |
| **Goals and  Objectives**:  The overall  goal is to provide an alternative way to order food related to a specific  recipe. The site is expected to: provide a responsive interface to interact  with the site, function in a simple and intuitive way and to provide some web  pages only to registered users |
| **Schedule  Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**:  4/12/2019- Project Charter Complete  xx/12/2019  xx/12/2019 |
| **Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**:  Not Available |
| **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:**  Dates are not flexible without the project manager permission.  Roles are changeable based on workload of individual team members or problems  regarding the project. Roles are expected to shift throughout the project as needs arise. |
| **Approach:** Scrum method is used to develop the project. The first sprint  will focus on the  basic  functionality of the website. |
| **Constraints**: The content of the page  must follow the internet guidelines and the rules given by the sponsors. |
| **Assumptions**: Our team will work in the schools labs or in remote with  laptops. |
| **Success  Criteria**: The project will be considered a  success if the team delivers an operational project at the end of the  deadline with all the function described in the goal. |
| **Scope**: The website will allow users to  order ingredients, and to see a list of different recipes. Time permitting  the scope could be extended to include other features like for example a personal  page with all the user information. |
| **Risks and  obstacles to success**: A risk the team faces is a lack of  experience in developing web pages and databases. This lack of experience  generates a lot of unknowns. We have  only an idea of the level of work required for the features we have committed  to. We do not yet have a clear picture  of how the code will be implemented. |
